I am a researcher working at the intersection of **nuclear safety, radiation biology, and AI**.  
I am currently completing an **MSc in Radiation Biology** at the University of Oxford and a specialising **MEng in Nuclear Safety** at Politecnico di Milano.  

My work focuses on **radiation risk, nuclear health security, and applications of machine learning** to evidence review and risk modelling. I have worked with the **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)**, the **UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)**, and the **European Space Agency (ESA)**.
